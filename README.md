Midway Project checkpoint writeup: 
Produces a randomized STL. 
For this project I will use python from personal preference and its nice stl handling. I will begin with a list of possible vertices and planes. Then, I will use math.random to randomize the exact points that will be used. Next, I will need to implement some simple version of convex hull to ensure that the final stl is 3dprintable and not infinately small or thin in any area. Additions may include adding several randomized stls together in a mathematically random fashion or using data from mp3 files to have a controled randomness based on music. After I have generated several different files, I will pick my favorite to 3d print. Mostly the compelx part is having the vertices and planes match even when randomized and convex hull is alittle bit of an obsticle. However, there are plenty of solutions. to the concave issue such as adding multiple stls together.
